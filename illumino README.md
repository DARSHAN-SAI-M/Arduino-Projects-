# ðŸŒ™ Illumino â€“ Automatic Light Using Arduino & LDR

**Illumino** is a beginner-friendly Arduino project that automatically turns on an LED in low-light conditions using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). This project introduces you to analog sensors, voltage dividers, and conditional automation â€” perfect for learning the basics of electronics and Arduino programming.
